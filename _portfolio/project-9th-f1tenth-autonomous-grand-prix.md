## 📌 Problem
[RoboRacer](https://roboracer.ai/) (formerly F1Tenth) is the leading platform for autonomous racing education and research, fostering interest, excitement, and critical thinking about the increasingly ubiquitous field of autonomous systems. Each year, a number of autonomous race car competitions are held to bring the international community together where teams from all around the world gather to compete. The teams will build a 1:10 scaled autonomous race car according to a given specification and write software for it to fulfill the objectives for the competition: Don’t crash and minimize laptime.

## 👤 Role
As part of the team "Scuderia Segfault", I co-built and co-developed the full software stack for perception, planning and control of our 1:10 scaled autonomous race car.

## 🛠️ Solution
- Developed, implemented and improved SOTA LiDaR-based perception, planning and control algorithms (reactivate methods e.g. follow-the-gap and tracking algorithms e.g. pure pursuit)
- Evaluated and optimized algorithms for latency-criticality when controlling autonomous racing cars at high frequencies
- Performed raceline optimizations for the outlined track of the in-person competition

## 📈 Impact
Our team "Scuderia Segfault" achieved the first place in the time trials and the head-to-head in-person competition at the [9th F1Tenth Autonomous Grand Prix](https://iros2021.f1tenth.org/) at IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2021, showing the strength and robustness of our algorithms not just in simulation, but in a real-world contest.
